# Perceptron Network

This program trains a perceptron network to differentiate between 9x7 representations of the letters A, B, C, and D.

When evaluating, the program will output whichever of the letters the input file looks like (or none of them if applicable).
Training & input files should look as follows:
```
..##...
...#...
...#...
..#.#..
..#.#..
.#####.
.#...#.
.#...#.
###.###```
